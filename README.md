# Neural Network Charity Analysis


The purpose of this project is to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. For this project, I implemented a Deep Learning model in order to evaluate more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years.

## Results


### Data Preprocessing

* What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
.

* What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
.

* What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
.



### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

* How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
.

* Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
.

* What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
.
